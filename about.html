          <h2>Who Am I?
          </h2>
          <p>The simple answer is no one... edgy I know. But to the facing public I am anonymous, for now atleast.
              I am currently a first year computer science student, I started coding 8 years ago for fun, but it never
              really amounted to anything. This time I am far more motivated due to interests and life circumstances. 
              That's pretty much all im comfortable sharing at the moment... I know, what do you mean all? you didn't 
              share anything... I'll get there once day.

          <h2>My Interests</h2>
          <p>I like to run... far, very far. I like solving problems and I like learning. I like food and foreign countries
            I drink alot of tea and I exercise quite abit... did I mention running... I really love to run.

            Well goodbye for now and keep software free.

            <h2>Achievements</h2>
              <p>Things I have done in life:
                <ul>
                  <li>Graduated Highschool</li>
                  <li>Cert IIII in Multimedia</li>

                  <li>Bachelor Audio Production</li>

          <h2>Anything else to add?</h2>
          <p>Yes! there is alot to add, but this is not the time or place for it.... Yes stupid I know, I am rather dumb, I have uncovered
            this much about myself so far in life. But I also become incredibly dedicated to whatever i'm focused on, and right now that 
            is computer science and everything encompassing it... that includes the Math, I truly do love the math. So watch this space,
            I promise it will turn into something one day... and no.. probably nothing to do with web design... if you couldn't tell, I don't
            exactly have a nack for it. My focus long term is on cyber security and data science. Web design, although is very interesting is
            just a way for me to share my ideas for now... and I kinda like making things and putting them online to be seen.
